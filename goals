XFLRPY goals

1. Very natural and self explanatory API (ex. numpy) --InProcess
2. Remote procedure calls with python library --InProcess
3. As little changes to original code as possible. If possible, create an extension and don't change the original code at all. --NotInProcess(tuff)
4. Only calls and design loops in python, all computation in C++ --MaybeInProcess
5. Highly object oriented --InProcess
