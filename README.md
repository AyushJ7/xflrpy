## Note
This repository is under development and experimental. As a result there are not many features or refined code
practices as of yet. Any and every contribution/constructive criticism is welcome. 

# xflrpy
xflrpy is an attempt to generate python bindings for the powerful software called [xflr5](http://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm) created
by Andr√© Deperrois. The original software is capable of the design and low-fidelity analysis of airfoils and 
mode aircraft and is hosted at [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xflr5/).

# Why?
I undertook this project while learning a bit of C++. This repository is aimed at exposing a neat
and equally powerful python API for the original project to make it easier for scripting/automation 
and design optimization applications. I understand fully that there already exist software like
openVSP which do the same thing essentially. But Hey. It's fun.

# How?
Some standard ways of exposing C code to python include using wrappers like [SWIG](https://github.com/swig/swig), 
Boost and [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). Luckily for us, xflr5 is written using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) 
which means there exist even more tools like [shiboken](https://github.com/pyside/Shiboken)
and [PythonQt](https://github.com/MeVisLab/pythonqt) to make life easier. For this project 
I'm using PythonQt for now and did a bit of experimenting with Pybind11(never pushed the commits though). 

Exposing the entire software as a python library involves rewriting a lot of the code and is beyond the scope 
of this project. The current version involves building the software which includes an embedded python 
interpreter. 

## So..How to build it?
For Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):
(These instructions are basic and just an extension of [this](https://github.com/polmes/xflr5-ubuntu) repo.

Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/nikhil-sethi/xflrpy.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd pythonqt
export PYTHON_VERSION = <Your_python_version> (eg: 3.8)
export PYTHON_DIR = <Your_python_directory> {eg: /usr/bin/)

sudo apt install build-essential mesa-common-dev mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

Build 
(You will need Qt>=5. Check out their page for installing it)
```
cd ..
qmake # or wherever it's located
make all 
```

Link
(PythonQt needs some linking of shared libraries which is not automated as of yet. This might depend on your Linux
distro so you might need to check for yourself.)
```
echo "<path_to_xflrpy>/pythonqt/lib" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/pythonqt.conf
sudo ldconfig
```

If everything worked correctly, you should be able to start xflr5
```
./xfr5-gui/xflr5
```
